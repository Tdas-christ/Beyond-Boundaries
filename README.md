The search for habitable exoplanets has long been a contentious issue in astronomy. Traditional methods for identifying exoplanets include the wobble method, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, and others, all of which require a significant commitment of labor, time, and money. The transit method has been used to discover most verified exoplanets. A planet may migrate in front of its host star, blocking a portion of its light and causing its observed visual brightness to decline by a small percentage, depending upon the relative sizes of the host star and its planet.
